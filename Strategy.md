### Build team + culture
hiring 2 software developers with personal and cultural fit
        = 1 full stack, experienced, generalist, priority on tech skills
        = 1 full stack, generalist, potential to learn, priority on hardware experience and affinity
create / update ‘handbook’ with mission, vision, values, and processes
= write down and share on the public repository, as well as send specifically to teammembers.

### Be profitable

Develop Version Control for Hardware
all individual elements (files, texts, BOM, process guides) build up reversible history
users can create clones and branches of projects
users can create merge requests across clones and branches, and merge changes.
users can -in browser- identify and visually compare changes between 2 clones or branches in project’s structure, meta content, and content (inc texts, BOM, and process guides, and for each type of file for all major open standard file formats).
