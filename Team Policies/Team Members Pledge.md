# Team Members Pledge 

This is our pledge in how we work with you as a team member. We will at all times try our very best to live by this pledge. 
We must say that this pledge does not modify the agreements that you, as an existing or new team member, are signing. In the rare case of a conflict, the agreements will control. To help you understand our view, we want to share our additional thoughts: 



### Purpose of our employment agreements
These are written as for worst-case scenarios, so there is always a clear legal understanding for both parties.
It is in the end completely up to us as the executives (more technically, the board) whether we would ever enforce what is in the agreement.


### Our philosophy on working with you as team members
We believe that it is in the mutual interest of Wevolver and its teammembers for you to be happy, productive and to progress as much as you can, and that working at Wevolver should be in line with your life goals.
We completely trust you. We don’t track hours worked and let you decide where you work from. You are allowed to determine your own working hours and place unless the nature of your role and responsibilities requires differently.

You can take as much time off as you need, ass long as you ensure you are able to fulfill the responsibilities and tasks related to your role:
For any time off that’s less then 21 consecutive calendar days you do not need to ask permission, as long as you make sure that your job responsibilities are covered while you are away, and that you make your absence known to your team members. To help your fellow team members we ask to announce time off as soon as possible, at least twice as long as the amount of leave you want to take (eg 2 days’ notice for 1 day’s leave).
We strongly recommended to take at least a minimum of 2 weeks of time off per year


### Intellectual Property
By default the company owns all the IP of any work that you do during your working hours and also for any work that falls within the competitive scope of Wevolver. All other work outside of that is owned by you.

We think it’s good if you have side projects. If you have an idea or you’re working on something, please share it with the team. We want to help as much as we can in succeeding in such side projects while you work on your goals and responsibilities within Wevolver. We also ask you to declare any real, or perceived, conflicts of interest and negative impacts on your work at Wevolver promptly, so we can mutually resolve these.
If at some point you are thinking that somewhere else might be a better fit than Wevolver, we might be sad but we’ll be excited to help you find the very best place for you to be and thrive. 


We are here to help you have an amazing time, create great work that makes you proud, and grow your knowledge and skills  as much as you can. 


*On behalf of Wevolver,*
*Bram & Richard*
