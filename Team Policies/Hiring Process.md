# Hiring Process & Approach

## Intention:
At Wevolver we aim to find the people with the best fit for our company culture, ambitions, and of course for the role. For them we create an environment where motivated people can thrive.
During this hiring process we also aim to give you a great experience. Whether it works out or not, we aim that you enjoy the process and learn something from it.


## How we go about this:
We are thorough in our approach. Both Wevolver and candidates benefit from being able to assess as good as possible; “is there a fit?”
We try to make the assessment as objective as possible. 
1. You will speak with and be reviewed by multiple Wevolver team members who will perform an independent assessment.
2. We make the process as uniform as possible for every candidate.
When you are applying for a technical role possessing the right skills is important. However, in the initial interviews we focus on the essential ‘soft skills’ for having a great time at Wevolver. Only afterwards we will move to technical screening.

#### Attributes we look for:
- General Cognitive Ability
    - Can you learn and adapt to new situations.
- Leadership
    - So called ‘emergent leadership,’ NOT traditional leadership. Having the character and social competence to steer things in the right direction without necessarily having the authority to do so, in a collaborative way. Do you, at the appropriate time, step in and lead, and, do you step back and stop leading, do you let someone else? 
- ‘Wevolver’
    - Are you aligned with our [values](https://github.com/Wevolver/Handbook/blob/master/Strategy.md#values--guiding-principles)?
    - Are you enthusiastic, motivated. Do you value learning and developing yourselves. A positive, ‘can do’ attitude.’
- Role specific skills (e.g. technical skills for software development roles).
    

At the same time this is an iterative process, we are constantly learning, and we are flexible to adapt our approach, both to improve ourselves or to accommodate for unusual circumstances at Wevolver or at yours. 


### Process
#### Overview
1. We email questions to get an indication of technical and company-culture fit for the role, and decide to move forward.*
2. Two video interviews to further assess company-culture fit, and indicate personal fit with the team. This also allows you to learn more about working at Wevolver.
3. A 6hr ‘sample project’ to assess technical skills and mutually experience working together.
4. Video interview where you present your work and we discuss technical-fit for the role.
5. Either a decision or gathering of additional information (from both sides) needed to make a decision.

##### \*Initial information needed to assess potential technical and company-culture fit for the role:
- Why specifically are you interested in working at Wevolver?
- Tell about 1 or two recent projects that are worth mentioning in which you used Python. Specify your role if it was a team project, and what challenges you overcame.
-  Similarly, tell about a project where you also got involved in the front-end. 
- How would you rate your skills in Python, specifically Django, and how in Javascript?
- Do you have a Github/Stack Overflow account etc? An Angellist, Linkedin, Twitter profile, or a blog?
- Currently based?
- Would you be able to work with us in Amsterdam for 3 months?
- Compensation Expectations ([read about our compensation policy here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jyq28ioyh4TukuVJbSqv_Lu_tJFfS0BstDULtrGDF3E/edit?pli=1#heading=h.j3ot02s5jd21))
- Where did you read about our open position?

Candidates are encouraged to ask any question at any time during the process needed to assess if Wevolver fits them.
