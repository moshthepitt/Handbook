# Hiring Process & Approach

### Intention:
At Wevolver we aim to find the people with the best fit for our company culture, ambitions, and of course for the role. For them we create an environment where motivated people can thrive.
During this hiring process we also aim to give you a great experience. Whether it works out or not, we aim that you enjoy the process and learn something from it.

### How we go about this:
We are thorough in our approach. Both Wevolver and candidates benefit from being able to assess as good as possible; “is there a fit?”
We try to make the assessment as objective as possible. 
1. You will speak with and be reviewed by multiple people who will perform an independent assessment.
2. We make the process as uniform as possible for every candidate.
When you are applying for a technical role possessing the right skills is important. However, in the initial interviews we focus on the essential ‘soft skills’ for having a great time at Wevolver. Only afterwards we will move to technical screening.

Attributes we look for:
- General Cognitive Ability
    - Can you learn and adapt to new situations
- Leadership
    - So called ‘emergent leadership,’ NOT traditional leadership. Having the character and social competence to steer things in the right direction without necessarily having the authority to do so, in a collaborative way. Do you, at the appropriate time, step in and lead, and, do you step back and stop leading, do you let someone else? 
- ‘Wevolver’
    - Are you aligned with our [values](https://github.com/Wevolver/Handbook/blob/master/Strategy.md#values--guiding-principles)?
    - Are you enthusiastic, motivated. Do you value learning and developing yourselves. A positive, ‘can do’ attitude.’
- Role specific skills (e.g. technical skills for software development roles)
    

At the same time this is an iterative process, we are constantly learning, and we are flexible to adapt our approach, both to improve ourselves or to accommodate for unusual circumstances at Wevolver or at yours. 


### Note:
*This is fuelled by our own experience, and the incredible generous support and feedback we have had from our peers & advisers (you will know it if we mean you here, (thanks again)). Many books and articles have helped as well. Especially the book 'Work Rules!' by Laszlo Bock (article by Laszlo [here](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hire-like-google)*
