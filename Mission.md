# WHY
## MISSION
Enable anyone, anywhere to develop hardware technology

Why this matters: We believe there is a societal need for innovation and intrinsic human drive to create. 

The result of our mission: When anyone is able to develop hardware, individuals, communities, and organizations of all kind are empowered to learn, solve challenges, and start new ventures.
These increased opportunities generate innovation, and increase social welfare.


# HOW
## APPROACH
We are enabling decentralized collaboration on both public and private hardware projects on the Wevolver platform.
Collaboration can be within private teams, open communities, or with an artificial intelligent system.

We think the best organization create and deliver this technology and service adheres to the following model:

### Open Core:
We follow an open-core model where as much of the source code of the Wevolver platform as possible is open source. Wevolver is collaborating with a software development community on its source code.

### Open Culture:
We believe pragmatically that being as open as possible both internally and externally results in a more effective organization with happier people. We also believe that being as open as possible is generally a good thing.
Everything we do is public by default. There are exceptions and we are open about what pragmatically or morally is not made public.

### For Profit Public Benefit:
Wevolver will set up as a public benefit company where our mission ranks pari passu with creating shareholder value. We have a charter that expresses our social impact commitment. https://www.wevolver.com/charter/ (needs updating)
Wevolver chose to set up as a company because it enables to generate the necessary funding to continuously innovate and improve Wevolver's application and services. This reflects the funding needed in Wevolver’s initial starting phase, as well as the long term revenue to continue to innovate its technology.
It also provides Wevolver the necessary independency and agility to continuously create value for its users and the wider society.  


## VALUES & GUIDING PRINCIPLES
### Make a Big Positive Impact
Why:
We believe this is the core reason why Wevolver exist
We are in the position to make a big impact.
How:
By making a Big (number of people using + amount of impact we make on their lives) Positive (enabling anyone to create technology) Impact on society & on our team member's lives (enjoyable & meaningful work, using and growing talents and skills).

### Be Open and Transparent
Why:
We believe this is key for making a positive impact, for collaboration, for creativity, and because openness is the best 'default mode.'
It results in positivity, is pragmatically more effective for executing, collaboration and creativity.
How:
Acting and being honest in what we say and do, open and clear about our goals.
Take the 'Do Good' approach, where you don't say or do anything that you know or feel has a negative impact on others.

### Create Quality
Why:
We believe that valuing quality leads to better long term results, creates meaning, makes a positive impact.
How:
Choose quality over quantity, long term over short term.
Continuously learn and improve yourself. Work effectively.

### Be Collaborative and Creative
Why:
We believe collaborating is necessary for creating quality and impact, and getting things done.
Creative work is enjoyable and meaningful, creativity is necessary for qualitative solutions that can make a positive impact.
How:
Work with others, take risk, try new things/experiment.
Leave your ego at the door.

### Execute
Why:
We believe that in the end more important than talking about things is executing them, doing what you say, it is the only way to make impact.
How:
Set goals.
Keep yourself and others accountable for the goals you set out to achieve.
Take an iterative approach.
Get clear what the minimum thing is you need to do in order to create value.


# WHAT
## STRATEGY
### Product Vision
- Provide a centrally accessible repository, tailored for sharing all documentation of hardware projects.
- Enable public and private projects.
- Enable version control and a ‘cloning and branching’ workflow.
- Provide access to Wevolver via a responsive web-application and native mobile applications.
- Design the UX of the application to be easy to use for users from a wide range of backgrounds and abilities.
- Design the architecture of Wevolver to enable connections with other tools, services and resources that are essential for hardware development, enabling users to integrate their Wevolver workflow with external tools.

### Development Strategy
First build a great repository for sharing hardware projects (get problem/solution fit).
Focus on building a body of open source hardware content and a community of open hardware developers (inc startups and organizations).
Enable decentralized collaboration by developing version control for hardware.
Deploy the business model where users pay for private repositories and establish 'product/market fit.'
Continuously improve quality, while gradually increasing scope of functionality,
Grow users of both private and public projects

#### Assumptions
- Instead of offering solutions for each narrow hardware engineering discipline , we should offer a single solution for the whole multidisciplinary teams and communities.
- The needs of developers of both private and public projects are close enough to be fulfilled on a single platform.
- Hardware developers need tailored UX to translate the concept of version control and its workflows from software development processes

#### Future Technology Ideas
- Leveraging blockchain technology for:
    - securely storing people’s contributions to projects.
    - building a truly decentralized infrastructure for storing projects and user’s interactions.
- Leveraging VR/AR to support people during the hardware development process, and support in bridging the digital and physical realms of hardware development.
- Leveraging AI to provide people support during the engineering process.


# Notes
*(expressed for example by K. Kelly, What Technology Wants, 2011). 
*Research at MIT has shown that products developed by end-users are the largest source of successful innovations, and user-innovation has a positive impact on social welfare (these so called ‘Lead Users’ consist of individuals as well as organizations)(E. von Hippel, Democratizing Innovation, 2006).
