## 2017 OKRs WEVOLVER
*What are OKRs? -> Read more [here](https://www.talentcove.com/okrs/what-are-okrs.html)*


### Build team + culture
- hiring 2 software developers with personal and cultural fit 
    - 1 full stack, experienced, generalist, priority on tech skills 
    - 1 full stack, generalist, potential to learn, priority on hardware experience and affinity 
- create / update ‘handbook’ with mission, vision, values, and processes
    - review quarterly 
    - update if content changes or new content gets created 
- establish team communication and accountability practices 
    - routine for communicating company strategy and OKRs 
    - routine for communicating and reviewing individual’s OKRs (inc progress) + routinely reviewing overall happiness, growth, alignment with company values, and work output 
    - written down and shared team wide in internal handbook and planned in calendar(s) of the team 
- establish founders rules and practices that shape our culture (e.g. how do/don’t we express ourselves, how do we act (expressing work and life attitude)) 
    - written down in measurable way, progress tracked through feedback and self review monthly. 


### Be profitable
        - make £15,000 RR p/m / or more if you have increased spending / or reduce costs if you make less
        - enable private projects and achieve problem solution fit for private companies = 20% long term retention
        - establish key user engagement metrics that result in activation and retention, set targets, measure progress.

### Grow active hardware community around our mission and vision
        - Align social media expression and activity with main objective

### Optimize repository functionality
        - improve Functionality, UX, Customer Relations (e.g. notifications), resulting in retention curve flattening at +20%
                >need to check if public/private users have separate retention metrics (both should be at least 20%)
        - optimize global performance >needs baseline and targets (will be set with new dev team)

### Develop Version Control for Hardware
        -all individual elements (files, texts, BOM, process guides) build up reversible history
        -users can create clones and branches of projects
        -users can create merge requests across clones and branches, and merge changes.
        -users can -in browser- identify and visually compare changes between 2 clones or branches in project’s structure, meta content, and content (inc texts, BOM, and process guides, and for each type of file for all major open standard file formats).
        -stable 1.0 version released as open source software
                >update (once setting goals with dev team) to determine what actually gets released and the resulting usage metrics
        -achieve a 65% DAU/MAU ratio for paying users (shows the average user is using Wevolver each workday)

### Optimize Repository Functionality
>note: together with the new tech team we review strategy and  software roadmap and decide whether to first optimize repository or first build version control. This is both a business and tech decision. 

        - improve Functionality, UX, Customer Relations (e.g. notifications), achieve 65% DAU/MAU for private beta users
        - optimize global performance >needs baseline and targets (will be set with new dev team)
