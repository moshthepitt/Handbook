# Handbook

In this handbook we share as much as we can about the blueprint of the Wevolver organisation. 

[Wevolver](www.wevolver.com) is a collaboration platform for hardware development. A "Github for Hardware."  
We build Wevolver to enable anyone, anywhere to develop hardware technology.  
Our platform is used globally by engineers to collaborate on both open-source and private projects.  
With a deep commitment to open-source, we share and contribute back to our community.
